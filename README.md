ON HOW TO RUN FILE IN THIS CODE, compile the c++ file
Then, run this type of command in your command promt (in Windows, different for Linux)

c++_sort.exe testcase\testcase_01.input
MergeSort.exe testcase\testcase_01.input
etc...

For numpy, use the command

python numpy_sort.py

if you want to change the input file, go to the python source code, then change the filename part in main() function into which input you want
for example:

filename = "testcase\testcase_10.input"

then save and run the above command again
